# Pokemon_Types
Simple program that makes some evaluations about pokemon types and types combinations in order to create a profile.

The profile shows, for each combination:
 - Weaknesses: which types cause damage, and how much damage they cause;
 - Resistances: Which types cause less damage, and how much less they cause;
 - Strategic value: how good is the combination. This value is based on the previous two components of the profile and on type frequency;
